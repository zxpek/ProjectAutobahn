## Load data and libraries
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(reshape)
library(plyr)
mat_ds <- read.csv("data/student-mat.csv", header=TRUE)
por_ds <- read.table("data/student-por.csv", sep=";", header=TRUE)


```

## Initial look at the dataset
```{r}
head(mat_ds, n = 10)
head(por_ds, n = 10)
```

## Overarching Question
What demographic, social, and school related variables affect test scores in a high school environment? Do these factors differ in a math versus as language class?

# Dataset Description
Source: Paulo Cortez, University of Minho, GuimarÃ£es, Portugal, http://www3.dsi.uminho.pt/pcortez
This data samples student achievement in secondary education of two Portuguese schools. 
The data was collected by using school reports and questionnaires. 
Two datasets are included regarding the performance in two distinct subjects: Mathematics (mat) and Portuguese language (por). 
The dataset contains 32 Variables. Most variables are categorical across a number of factors that attempt to predict end of the semester scores.

## Convert Factors to Numeric
```{r}
por_ds$schoolD <- por_ds$school
levels(por_ds$schoolD) <- c(0, 1)
por_ds$schoolD <- as.numeric(as.character(por_ds$schoolD))

por_ds$sexD <- por_ds$sex
levels(por_ds$sexD) <- c(0, 1)
por_ds$sexD <- as.numeric(as.character(por_ds$sexD))


```



## Descriptive Statistics
```{r}
#slice data in different ways

round(prop.table(table(por_ds$sex,por_ds$school),margin = 2),2)

ddply(por_ds, .(school), summarize, mean = mean(G3), sd = sd(G3))

# Most of the students in this data set study at Gabriel Pereira (772 out of 1044)
# Female Percent
f_pct <- paste0(nrow(student_ds[student_ds[,"sex"] == "F",]) / nrow(student_ds) * 100, "%")
# 56.6% female students
# Male Percent
m_pct <- paste0(nrow(student_ds[student_ds[,"sex"] == "M",]) / nrow(student_ds) * 100, "%")
# 43.4% male students
# Average grade of female students
f_grade <- mean(student_ds[student_ds[,"sex"] == "F", "G3"])
# 11.44839
# Average grade of male students
m_grade <- mean(student_ds[student_ds[,"sex"] == "M", "G3"])
# 11.20309


```



## Correlations

You'll need the package GGally for this

```{r}
nonFactors<- c(3,7,8,13,14,15,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33) #List of nonfactor columns
pairs(mat_ds[,c(30,31,32,33)],col=mat_ds$Fedu)

mat_ds.sub<-as.data.frame(mat_ds[,c(30,31,32,33,7,8)])
#ggpairs(mat_ds.sub)

correlations <- cor(por_ds[,unlist(lapply(por_ds, is.numeric))])

melted_cormat <- melt(correlations)
melted_cormat
ggplot(melted_cormat, aes(x = X1, y = X2, fill = value)) + geom_tile()
```

## All pairwise correlations

```{r}
cor.vec<-matrix(nrow=dim(mat_ds)[2],ncol=dim(mat_ds)[2])
for (i in 1:dim(mat_ds)[2]) {
  for (j in 1:dim(mat_ds)[2]) {
    if (i != j) {
      cor.vec[i,j] <- as.numeric(try(cor(mat_ds[,i],mat_ds[,j]),silent=TRUE)) 
    }
  }
}

which(abs(cor.vec) > 0.4, arr.ind=TRUE)

```

##Paired t-tests

```{r}
t.test(mat_ds$G1,mat_ds$G2,paired=TRUE) #Checking for improvement in score
t.test(por_ds$G1,por_ds$G2,paired=TRUE) 

#Checks that scores increase similarly across tests (Difference in score between G2 and G1)
mat_ds$scoreDiff1<-mat_ds$G2 - mat_ds$G1
por_ds$scoreDiff1<-por_ds$G2 - por_ds$G1
t.test(mat_ds$scoreDiff1,mat_ds$scoreDiff1)


#do a t.test between male and female grades.
# t.test between the two schoools. 
# Difference between female and male proportions with respect to certain characteristics
prop.test(table(student_ds$sex, student_ds$activities), correct = FALSE)
#prop test make sure the y/n is on the columns
prop.test(table(student_ds$nursery, student_ds$sex), correct = FALSE)
prop.test(table(student_ds$higher, student_ds$sex), correct = FALSE)
prop.test(table(student_ds$internet, student_ds$sex), correct = FALSE)
prop.test(table(student_ds$romantic, student_ds$sex), correct = FALSE)


```
Difference in score for mat_ds(math) is insignificant, but significant for por_ds(portugese)

## Some quick ANOVA

Just to explore a bit further

```{r}
Edu.aov<-aov(mat_ds$G3 ~ mat_ds$Fedu + mat_ds$Medu)
Alc.aov<-aov(mat_ds$G3 ~ mat_ds$Walc + mat_ds$Dalc)
Job.aov<-aov(mat_ds$G3 ~ mat_ds$Mjob + mat_ds$Fjob)
summary(aov(mat_ds$G3 ~ factor(mat_ds$studytime)))
ggplot(data=mat_ds,aes(factor(Mjob),G3))+geom_boxplot()
```


## PCA

```{r}
mat_ds.sub<-as.data.frame(mat_ds[,c(7,8,26,27,28,30,31,32,33)])

mat_ds.sub<-as.data.frame(mat_ds[,nonFactors])
mat_ds.pca<-prcomp(mat_ds.sub,scale=TRUE,center=TRUE)

pairs(as.matrix(mat_ds.sub)%*%as.matrix(mat_ds.pca$rotation)[,1:7],col=mat_ds$traveltime)
mat_ds.pca$rotation
```

## Linear Models
```{r}
# questions to ask. does mom or dad's education status and/or job affect scores more
# looks like having a romantic interest distracts students from studying
# also looks like urban students do better than rural ones
# one of the schools does way better than the other? can we find out how much of that school variation is due to the school vs other characteristics

mopor_ds <- lm(formula = student_ds$G3 ~ student_ds$higher + student_ds$studytime +

summary(mopor_ds)
